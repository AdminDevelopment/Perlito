Perlito5 Data model Overview

method call
- lookup the method in the _class_ attribute
- if the lookup fails, than do a normal javascript method lookup
- do a native call on the method

subroutine call 
- lookup the subroutine in the current namespace
- if not found, lookup the subroutine in CORE
- do a native method call, but the first argument is set to "CallSub"

Hash
- native {}

Array
- native []

Scalar
- native

HashRef
- native {} with prototype "HashRef"

ArrayRef
- TODO

ScalarRef
- TODO

Object
- native {} with a _class_ attribute

Class
- TODO

Namespace
- current namespace is v__NAMESPACE
- v__NAMESPACE inherits from CORE, which inherits from CORE::GLOBAL
- v__NAMESPACE is a copy of the Class, but with a different inheritance
- v__NAMESPACE and Class are updated in parallel, both when a sub is declared or when using typeglob assignment

Calling context ("wantarray", caller)
- TODO

Alias
- TODO

List (eg. subroutine return value)
- native []
