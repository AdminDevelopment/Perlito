Perlito5 Data model Overview


method call
- lookup the method in the _class_ attribute; follow the class hierarchy until the UNIVERSAL base class.
- do a native call on the method. The invocant is the first argument. "this" is not used.

subroutine call 
- lookup the subroutine in the current namespace; follow the hierarchy until the CORE base class.
- do a native method call. "this" is not used.

Hash
- native {}

Array
- native []

Scalar
- native

HashRef
- TODO
- native {} with prototype "HashRef"

ArrayRef
- TODO

ScalarRef
- TODO
- We could probably use String/Boolean/Number (boxed types) as SCALARs

Object
- native {} with a _class_ attribute

Class
- TODO

Namespace
- current namespace is v__NAMESPACE
- v__NAMESPACE inherits from CORE, which inherits from CORE::GLOBAL
- v__NAMESPACE is a copy of the Class, but with a different inheritance
- v__NAMESPACE and Class are updated in parallel, both when a sub is declared or when using typeglob assignment

Calling context ("wantarray", caller)
- TODO

Alias
- TODO

List (eg. subroutine return value)
- native []
