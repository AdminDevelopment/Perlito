MiniPerl6 "Perlito" compiler

Go backend

    Compiling to Go currently requires Perl 5:

    perl mp6.pl -Bgo t/04-op.t

    The Go release from about 11 Nov 2009 is required. Newer versions may not work.

Javascript backend - browser

    Open the file 'perlito.html' in a browser (Firefox, Chrome, or Safari).

    Alternately, browse to:

    http://perlcabal.org/~fglock/perlito.html

Javascript backend - command line

    Executing from the command line requires Perl 5 and a javascript compiler (V8 or Rhino):

    perl mp6.pl -Bv8 -e 'class Main { say "hello, World!" }'

    perl mp6.pl -Brhino -e 'class Main { say "hello, World!" }'

    See also: V8 homepage at http://code.google.com/apis/v8

Lisp backend

    ... (see util-lisp directory)

Parrot backend

    The parrot backend is not bootstrapped, and it doesn't pass all tests.

    The perl 5 backend can be used to compile MiniPerl6 to parrot:

    perl mp6.pl -Bparrot -e 'class Main { say "hello, World!" }'

    See also: Parrot homepage at http://www.parrot.org

Perl 5 backend

    perl mp6.pl -e 'class Main { say "hello, World!" }'

    See also: Perl 5 homepage at http://www.perl.org

AST output

    perl mp6.pl -Cast-json -e 'class Main { say "hello, World!" }'
