TODO list for Perlito6


* Perlito6

- rename directory Perlito to Perlito6

- move all internal packages inside Perlito6 namespace

- move tests from "t/" to "t6/"


* Eval.pm module

- add exceptions

- complete ast nodes implementation


* Command line compiler (src6/util/perlito6.pl)

- build Ast cache using JSON (we currently use Perl5 Data::Dumper) or XML (Go has XML and JSON input)

- option to build binaries (Lisp, Java, Go) or modules (Perl, Lisp, Javascript)

- add "make" capabilities (test file dates, etc)

- does it need a config file? (lib location, make details)

- add '-B' option (execute)


* Perlito6 in Javascript

- reuse the good parts of Perlito5 data model


* Perlito6 in Rakudo

- Rakudo should be able to execute Perlito6 directly. What do we need to fix in both sides?


* Perlito6 in Lisp

- test other Lisp implementations


* Perlito6 in Go

- document which release of Go to use


* Perlito6 in Perl5

(no issues at the moment)


* Perlito6 in Parrot

- finish OO, class variables

- fix die() parameter handling


* Perlito6 in Python

- module loading uses mangled filenames (with underlines); it should use dot-separated names instead.


* Perlito6 in Ruby

- module loading uses mangled filenames (with underlines); it should use dot-separated names instead.


* Missing Backends

- Haskell

- Clojure


* Missing Features

- detailed syntax errors

- type annotations - FIXED

- 'use v5' is not supported
  (maybe not needed for Perlito)

- no 'state', 'constant', 'local'

- debugger

- chain operators - supported by the grammar, but no AST representation

- "loop(;;)"

- "when"


* Missing Features of the Token sub-compiler

- no quantifiers - FIXED

- no variable interpolation

- use the new precedence parser


* Nice to Have

- 'perlito-format' script (see gofmt and perltidy)


* Tests

- run some tests from the standard test suite

- use Test.pm - FIXED


* Grammar

- item-assignment precedence is different from list-assignment

- captures like: / <a> <a>* / - the first capture must share storage with the second capture

- modify the grammar to return multi-line strings as multiple strings
  (this makes it easier to write a beautifier script)

- parse Namespaces as array of string (we are going to split them anyway)

- double quote variable interpolation - FIXED (without method calls)

- and expression interpolation 

- the grammar should be aware of function arity


* Semantics

- @a.values and %a.keys return Array
  These should return a List 

- Not implemented: %a = (list)
